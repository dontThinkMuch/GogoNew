<h3>1. Is my password secure?</h3>
<p>We are using firebase authentication service provided by Google which ensures that your password is encrypted and stored safely.</p>

<h3>2. How accurate is the distance and time calculated by the app?</h3>
<p>Initially, when you select a bus distance and time shown are provided by google api. Later on and till the time you select another bus, distance and time are calculated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula">Haversine formula</a>.</p> 

<h3>3. Why is google api not being used all the time for calculating distance and time?</h3>
<p>We are restricted to use google api request limited to 1000 per day. So, we can't use google api all the time.</p>
